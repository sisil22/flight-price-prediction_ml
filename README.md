# flight-price-prediction_ml

##Overview
In this analysis, the "flight_price_prediction" dataset was utilized, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction.

##Introduction
The project aimed to explore factors influencing fluctuations in flight ticket prices and identify a precise model for accurate price prediction. The project involved several stages, including Data Understanding, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and Modeling using techniques such as Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The analysis concluded with summarization and business recommendations.

##Key Findings
After completing various project stages, it can be concluded that XG BOOST IS THE BEST MODEL. This conclusion is supported by the following observations:
1. A high R2 Score of 0.9799, indicating a robust explanatory power.
2. A low RMSE of 0.1418 suggests precise predictions.
3. Despite a slightly higher MAPE at 0.2208, it remains within an acceptable range.

##Conclusion
Therefore, the key takeaway is that "Class" emerges as the most influential feature in making predictions, following the hyperparameter tuning process. Duration comes next in terms of influence.
